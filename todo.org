Alright, we are using the 1-to-1 contact model in Salesforce, which
means each individual contact should have an account with the same
name

I'm going to have to use the custom object importer
https://na10.salesforce.com/setup/dataImporter.app

And learn how to model them first, so I'm going to first import 10
accounts and 10 contacts.
* DONE Test importing 10 accounts, 10 contacts

** Test one:

first, import the contact CSV

second, import the account CSV

Ok, that wasn't terrible. However, it automatically took accounts and
made new contacts for them if there as an "&" in their name.

Part of the problem is that I tried to import based on the contact
name, but I really wanted to only import based on the account name.
** Solution
Use the custom wizard. Import Accounts.csv first. Then import contacts.csv.
